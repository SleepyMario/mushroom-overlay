# mushroom-overlay

Hello, this is just another Gentoo Overlay. 
Specialization will follow in a later stage :-)

The scid_vs_pc ebuild is usable, but when install next to the original scid keep in mind that both binaries are called 'scid' and still will give problems when opened in that way. Have mercy, it will be fixed as soon as I can.
